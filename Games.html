                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">With the ability to seamlessly move from
                                    ground to air each
                                    scenario presents unique challenges for the player. The core philosophy is to give
                                    the player as much control as possible and compensate with that in the level design
                                    by making it as challenging and punishing as possible to make the player fully
                                    utilize their freedom. This is inspired by the way Ultrakill differs from normal FPS
                                    games and how it gives the player maximum control and allows the player to be the
                                    only limiter of how they accomplish a level. The extra challenge leads the player to
                                    a more rewarding sense of accomplishment upon completing the more difficult and
                                    challenging level.

                                    This means that if there was an easier way to implement a functionality but it
                                    removed player agency without introducing a unique challenge then it was immediately
                                    disregarded as it went against the core spirit of the game. This worked as a
                                    challenge to myself during the development, as it let me develop and use systems
                                    that I had not used before, which proved to be a great learning opportunity.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">The driving mechanics were an extreme
                                    challenge for me and
                                    allowed me to become much more familiar with vector math and Unity’s physics system.
                                    The driving is made up of several individual pieces of logic that all work together
                                    to give a smooth driving experience.

                                    The main physics loop of the driving controls goes in order of updating itself on
                                    the normals of what surface it is on. It then uses that information to update the
                                    vehicles offset off the ground, its rotation to align with the ground, and finally
                                    the velocity based on a mixture of player input and physics.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">Flying was even more of a challenge for me,
                                    although the crux
                                    of the problems came this time, in the form of game design. This stemmed from the
                                    core creed of the project being player freedom. I wanted to allow the player to exit
                                    any ramp from any angle, and for the player to be able to have full pivot, yaw and
                                    roll controls. This initially brought a host of issues such as players being able to
                                    simply bypass the track by flying over it and simply making it impossible to design
                                    a track. This system primarily worked by rotating the vehicle first, then
                                    transforming the velocity vector by the rotation, which allowed the player to
                                    essentially rotate their way out of gravity, which just didn’t feel good, and was
                                    impossible to design around and was much harder to add outside force modifiers too.

                                    and its gliding
                                    system. I decided to limit the player a little bit by applying a slight drag and
                                    gravity effect that would cause the player to slowly lose velocity and fall
                                    downwards over time as they stayed in the air. Secondly, to fix the problem of being
                                    able to turn out of gravity too easily, I changed the process so that the vehicle's
                                    rotation was changed to face the velocity, and the player input added force to the
                                    current velocity in the direction they input, rather than directly controlling the
                                    vehicle's rotation. I also removed their ability to manually boost when in the air.
                                    This felt much more natural as a player and allowed me to actually design levels
                                    that would challenge a player, while still giving them immense freedom in their
                                    control.

                                    step was what type of game this should be. I debated on AI or multiplayer, but
                                    decided that was outside of the scope of this project. I eventually landed on a
                                    simple time trial, which would challenge the player and hopefully make them want to
                                    push the game mechanics to the limit to get the lowest time possible.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">Within that, I wanted the player to have to
                                    be more aware of
                                    the track and have to take advantage of the tight controls I had given them. This
                                    was solved, while having a discussion of the game over lunch with a friend who said
                                    the obvious solution, so obvious it had flown right past my head after being head
                                    deep in the project for over a month. That was to add obstacles and a shield to the
                                    player. This was a great learning opportunity for me, and a helpful reminder for my
                                    future projects.

                                    to choose between the available car models and select which track they want to race
                                    on. This helped deepen my understanding of UI elements and how to make an experience
                                    that is both easy to use for the user and easy for myself to update when adding in
                                    new tracks and cars.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">The first iteration of the track was made
                                    while developing the
                                    vehicle controller itself, and as such was sort of a mechanics testing ground. I
                                    also made the huge mistake of designing with actual art assets instead of
                                    greyboxing. Due to this, I ran into many issues of the gameplay becoming designed
                                    around the track rather than the track to fit the gameplay, as it was much more
                                    cumbersome to edit and change the track. All around, a big lesson learned.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">I did however learn a lot from making this
                                    first failed track
                                    and it helped the production of the second track go much faster. I corrected my
                                    first mistake, by starting first with a greybox of the level, with as minimal detail
                                    as possible. With the gray box, two main objectives were sought after. I first and
                                    foremost attempted to make a fun course that started off narrow, introducing the
                                    player slowly to each mechanic at their disposal. I would then open up more,
                                    diverging into multiple routes, each presenting a unique challenge and focusing on
                                    particular mechanics.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">The second objective was having multiple
                                    “visual plateau's”.
                                    These would be parts of the track that naturally created a view of the track, that
                                    builds up the character of the track and gives the player a more grand view of the
                                    track than their usual confined view on the track. Especially, since a tight and low
                                    visibility track was necessary in most places to enforce a sense of speed and
                                    adrenaline.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">The first change in this new track was
                                    making it much larger
                                    than the original track had ever been. The point of this game was to go as fast as
                                    possible and challenge the human reaction speed, and it included gliding and speed
                                    boosts that multiplied that challenge. As such, the track needed to be long, such
                                    that it was not able to be cleared in an instant. Jumps would also need to be long
                                    enough that gravity would be significantly pulling down on the player by the time
                                    they reach the next piece of track, except in cases where there were available air
                                    boosts. Areas with air boosts do however require the player to hit most of the
                                    available boost to upkeep momentum and not fall out of the sky.

                                    Star Wars Episode VIII, which was my favorite part of the movie. In order to create
                                    concept art, I first took a screenshot from the greybox at a few visual plateaus,
                                    sent them to my ipad, and used them as a base to paint over.

                                <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left;">In order to be able to quickly model out the
                                    level, I needed a
                                    way to be able to use assets multiple times across the entire track without worrying
                                    about the texture stretching or scaling inconsistently. In order to achieve this, I
                                    created a triplar shader that would use world coordinates for the UV map. This meant
                                    that no matter the asset, I could scale it and rotate it however I wanted and the
                                    textures world scale would be consistent, and snow would only appear on pixels
                                    facing upwards. I could then mix this with normal maps baked from high poly sculpts
                                    per object if they were available.
